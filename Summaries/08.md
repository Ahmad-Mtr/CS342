# üìö CS342 Software Engineering: Lecture 8 - Software Project Estimation (How Much? How Long?) üò¥

Alright, you've figured out *what* to build. Now for the scary questions: **How much will it cost?** and **How long will it take?** That's what this lecture is about.

## üéØ What is Software Project Estimation?

A software project plan needs you to *estimate* (make an educated guess about) a bunch of things:

*   **Cost:** How much money?
*   **Duration:** How long will it take?
*   **Effort:** How many person-hours of work?
*   **Staff Scheduling:** Who works on what, and when?
*   **Risk Management:** What could go wrong?
*   **Quality Assurance & Other Resources:** What else do we need?

## üé≤ Project Estimation Techniques: The Three Flavors of Guessing

There are three main ways to estimate a project:

1.  **Empirical Techniques (Gut Feeling & Experience)**
    *   Derived from **prior experience and observation**, not formulas.
    *   **Lazy explanation:** "Based on the last 5 projects I did that were like this one, it'll probably take 6 months."
    *   **Examples:** Expert Judgment, Delphi Method (getting a bunch of experts to guess and then agree).

2.  **Heuristic Techniques (Magic Formulas)**
    *   Uses a **mathematical formula** based on historical data.
    *   **Lazy explanation:** "Plug some numbers about the project into our special formula and it spits out an answer."
    *   **Formula:** `Estimated Resource = C1 * e^D1 + C2 * e^D2 + ...`
        *   `C` and `D` are constants from past projects.
        *   `e` is some characteristic of the software (like its size).

3.  **Analytical Techniques (The "Scientific" Way)**
    *   Uses a "scientific basis" to derive results.
    *   **Lazy explanation:** A more formal, theory-based approach.
    *   **Example:** Halstead's software science.

## üìè Measuring Software Size: How Big is It?

To estimate effort, you first need to estimate the *size* of the software.

*   **Lines of Code (LOC) - The BAD Way**
    *   **What it is:** Literally counting the lines of code.
    *   **Why it's bad:**
        *   It only measures the code, not the functionality. 1000 lines of genius code could do what 10,000 lines of sloppy code do.
        *   You can't compare LOC between different languages (10 lines of Python might equal 50 lines of C).
        *   It's like judging a book by its number of pages.

*   **Functional Points (FP) - The GOOD Way**
    *   **What it is:** Measures the **business functionality** the software provides to the user. It's independent of the technology or programming language used.
    *   **Why it's good:** It focuses on what the user *gets*, not how it was built. It's an official ISO standard!
    *   **Reduces Risk:** Better estimates reduce the risk of project termination, unstable requirements, and going over budget/schedule.

## üî¨ Functional Points Analysis (FPA): The Nitty-Gritty

This is the main technique for estimating software size. It looks complicated, but it's just a two-step calculation.

### The Big Formula:

`Total Adjusted Function Points = (Unadjusted Function Points) * (Adjusted Processing Complexity)`

Let's break down each part.

### Step 1: Calculate Unadjusted Function Points (UFP)

This is the "raw score" based on counting five types of functions in the software.

1.  **Inputs:** Screens for data entry (e.g., user registration form).
2.  **Outputs:** Reports, confirmation screens (e.g., a "Registration Successful" page).
3.  **Queries:** A request for data that gets an immediate response (e.g., searching for a user).
4.  **Interfaces:** Files/data sent to other systems (e.g., sending payment info to a credit card processor).
5.  **Files:** Logical data files the system uses (e.g., a "Users" table in the database).

You count how many of each you have, rate their complexity (low, medium, or high), and multiply by a weight.

`UFP = Œ£ (Count of each factor * its complexity weight)`

### Step 2: Calculate Adjusted Processing Complexity (APC)

This is a "fudge factor" that adjusts the raw UFP score based on the overall technical complexity of the system.

*   It's based on **14 General System Characteristics (GSC)**.
*   You rate each GSC on a scale of **0 (no effect) to 5 (highest effect)**.

**The 14 GSCs (General System Characteristics):**
*Data communications, Heavily use configuration, Transaction rate, End-user efficiency, Complex processing, Installation ease, Multiple sites, Performance, Distributed functions, On-line data entry, On-line update, Reusability, Operational ease, Extensibility.*

`APC = 0.65 + (0.01 * Total GSC Score)`
*The 0.65 and 0.01 are just "magic numbers" from the standard.*

## üî¢ FPA Example: Let's Do The Math!

Let's say we have a project with:
*   User Inputs = 50
*   User Outputs = 40
*   User Queries = 35
*   External Interfaces = 4
*   User Files = 6

**Assumption:** For this example, let's assume all complexity weights and all 14 GSC ratings are "average".

### Step A: Find the Average Weights

*   **UFP Factor Averages:**
    *   Input (scale 3-6): **Average = 4**
    *   Output (scale 4-7): **Average = 5**
    *   Queries (scale 3-6): **Average = 4**
    *   Interfaces (scale 5-10): **Average = 7**
    *   Files (scale 7-15): **Average = 11**
*   **GSC Average:**
    *   The scale is 0-5, so the **Average = 3**

### Step B: Calculate Unadjusted Functional Points (UFP)

| Measure Factor | Count | Average Weight |  Total  |
| :------------- | :---: | :------------: | :-----: |
| Inputs         |  50   |       4        |   200   |
| Outputs        |  40   |       5        |   200   |
| Queries        |  35   |       4        |   140   |
| Interfaces     |   4   |       7        |   28    |
| Files          |   6   |       11       |   66    |
| **Total UFP**  |       |                | **634** |

So, our **Unadjusted Function Points (UFP) = 634**.

### Step C: Calculate Adjusted Processing Complexity (APC)

*   Total GSC Score = 14 characteristics √ó 3 (average rating) = **42**
*   APC = 0.65 + (0.01 * Total GSC Score)
*   APC = 0.65 + (0.01 * 42) = 0.65 + 0.42 = **1.07**

### Step D: Calculate the Final Adjusted Function Points!

*   Total Adjusted FP = UFP * APC
*   Total Adjusted FP = 634 * 1.07 = **678.38** (Let's round to **678**)

The final estimated size of this project is **678 Function Points**. You can now use this number in other heuristic formulas to estimate cost and duration.

## üëé Functional Points Disadvantages

FPA isn't perfect.

*   **Not for all software:** It's bad for **real-time and embedded systems** (like the software in a car's engine).
*   **Designed for business systems:** It works best for things like banking apps, registration systems, etc., where data is the main focus.
*   **Depends on magic numbers:** The formula uses predefined constants that might not fit every project.

## ‚ú® FP Alternatives (For when FP doesn't fit)

*   **Feature Points:** Better for real-time/embedded systems. It adds a new characteristic to count: **algorithms**.
*   **3D Function Points:** Even more advanced. It measures three dimensions: **Data**, **Functional**, and **Control**.
